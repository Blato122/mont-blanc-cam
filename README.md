# mont-blanc-cam

The program automatically downloads the Tête Rousse and Goûter camera every hour between 07:00 and 21:59. 
Images from each camera are stored in separate folders: "tete_rousse" and "gouter".
This information helps track snow conditions in the infamous Grand Couloir, allowing mountaineers to plan 
their Mont Blanc hike when the conditions in the couloir are optimal.
